    <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
    <p>Below are two websites I evaluated using the CRAP design principles: Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity.</p>

    <!-- Good Website Section -->
    <section>
      <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple</a></h3>
      <p>Apple’s official site is sleek, simple, and well-organized, showcasing strong visual hierarchy and clean design.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Excellent use of light and dark tones to emphasize visuals and buttons.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent typography and layout across pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Perfectly aligned elements make the content easy to follow.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related items are grouped logically, improving readability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Bad Website Section -->
    <section>
      <h3><a href="https://www.torontocupcake.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toronto Cupcake</a></h3>
      <p>Toronto Cupcake’s site has a fun concept, but the design is cluttered with inconsistent spacing, busy backgrounds, and small text, making navigation harder than it should be.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Limited; some text blends into backgrounds and images, reducing readability.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Inconsistent use of fonts and colors, which makes the site feel less cohesive.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Some elements are misaligned or unevenly spaced, which interrupts visual flow.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related items are sometimes too far apart, and unrelated elements appear too close, making it harder to find information quickly.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  </main>
