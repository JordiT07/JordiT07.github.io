    <h2>Course Contract</h2>
    <p>
      I, Jordi Trejo, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my 
      Fall 2025, ITIS3135, Web Design and Development with my instructor, Professor 
      D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online 
      tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is 
      inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand 
      that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
      As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I understand that 
      it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. 
      I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not copy-paste code 
      except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
    </p>
